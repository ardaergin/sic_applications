# Redis Close Script (only for MacOS or Linux for now)

# This script closes the Redis connection if running. Script should
# be run on the local machine. The script will do this as followed:

# 1. **Gracefully terminate** Initially, it will try to kill the process gracefully.
# 2. **Forcefully terminate** If it cannot gracefully terminate, it will kill the process forcefully. 

# Instructions:
# 1. Make the script executable by running:
#    chmod +x redis_close.sh

# 2. Execute the script by running:
#    ./redis_close.sh
